What are release notes?
Release notes are how product managers and developers let users know about product improvements, major bug fixes, and brand new features. They’re typically kept in a feed, page, or blog category to make it easy for users to discover all of the new updates in one place.

Why write release notes?
Release notes are not an optional step in the release cycle. They’re an absolute must because they provide an opportunity to show prospective users and current users that your team is continually improving the product, taking feedback, and using it.
