### What are release notes?
As you may know many projects change over time. 
That's why we have different project versions.
Each version should inform users/customers about changes
to simplify migration between versions.
Release notes are document with details about 
product improvements, major bug fixes, and brand new features.

### There are two types of release notes for:
- developers (they need to know how contribute)
- users (they need to know how to use update)

### Why write release notes?

Release notes are not an optional step in the release cycle.
They inform your community about improving the product,
taking feedback, and using it.

**Benefits of writing release notes for every important release:**

- **Improve product utilization** - 
  When users know about changes, they know what new features
  to look out for and try. This gets them logging into your app, 
  trying new things, and ultimately using the product more.

- **Reduce churn** - If a user has been waiting for a new feature, you can 
  keep them from churning by letting them know about it as soon as it’s
  been released. Even if users aren’t directly waiting for a specific 
  feature or improvement, release notes help reduce churn by reminding 
  users that your company is always on top of the features they need.

- **Convert new customers** - New potential customers like to see that 
 your product is being continually improved and innovated. They want to 
 use something that is future-forward, will last for the long run, and
 won’t require them to migrate their data to some other tool. So, by 
 regularly publishing release notes in a public, easy-to-find place, 
 you show prospects that your development team is trustworthy.

- **Reduce support tickets** - The more users that know about your new 
 releases, the fewer users who will submit support requests asking when 
 a certain update will be released or a major bug will be fixed.

## Who’s in charge of release notes?
The role in charge of writing and publishing release notes will vary 
based on the size and complexity of the company. At one and two-person
startups, the lead developer will be in charge of writing release notes.
At medium-sized companies, this might be a product manager. While at 
large companies, release notes might be collaboratively handled by
multiple product managers and the head of product or chief product 
officer.

Amongst large teams, the person responsible for that release note will depend on the importance of the release and which product team built that update.
